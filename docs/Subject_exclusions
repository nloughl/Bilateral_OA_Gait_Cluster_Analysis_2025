Exclusions: 
Some subjects had multiple trials recorded.As seen in the preprocessing scripts, particular trials were exlcuded. The reasons are as follows: 
  Encounter id: E21-6-1-100 - used trial 00001 (trial 00002 was while using a walker)
                
                
Some subjects from 2023 data set had missing severity, kl score, and affected knee data. Likely asymptomatic controls. Need to cross reference with Redcap data.

Check E21-171 -- windswept case 

NOtes:  assummed 2025 dataset was filtered to only include the signal side of the worse leg as only 1 signal side exists per subject. In most cases signal_side matches worse_knee, however in unmatching cases it is because there are KL scores entered in this field (which generally match the score of the signal_side leg.)
