This project contains scripts for PCA, dimensionality reduction (multi-dimensional scaling), and hierachical clustering of markerless motions capture gait data. The subjects all have at least 1 knee with a clinical osteoarthritis rating of "severe". The gait data is from the subjects' self-selected 'normal pace' walk.
