# Bilateral OA Gait Clustering Analysis (2025) 
This project contains scripts for PCA, dimensionality reduction (multi-dimensional scaling), and hierachical clustering of markerless motions capture gait data. The subjects all have at least 1 knee with a clinical osteoarthritis rating of "severe". The gait data is from the subjects' self-selected 'normal pace' walk. 

Many clustering methods including Hierarchical (numerical data only), and mixed-data methods like PAM, KAMILA, and Modha-Spangler-PAM, were tested and evaluated by silhouette score, cluster stability (Jaccard Index), and adjusted rand index (ARI) before choosing the final clustering method. 

The RMarkdown files are the final versions of the code used for this project.
